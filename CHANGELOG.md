--------------------

## 0.3.5

- [x] Update documentation.

### JACS core

 - [x] add timestamp to prevent replay attacks to request/response features
 - [x] make cli utils available to other libs
 - [x] *** start effort to channel all logging to jacs -> open telemetry -> fs or elsewhere that doesn't write to stdio on 
    1. the main traffic for sign and verify
    2. all logs generated

### jacspy

 - [x] install python mcp libs with the python wheel, use python loader to extend/export jacs.so

## jacsnpm

proof of concept

 - [x] scaffold
 - [x] use refactored agent trait instead of replicating
 - [x] typescript mcp client and server tests
 - [x]  test sse mcp client and server
 - [x]  node express middleware


--------------------

# COMPLETED

## 0.3.4

## integrated demo

 - [x] sign request/response (any python object -> payload)
 - [x] verify response/request (any payload json string -> python object)
 - [x] integrate with fastMCP, MCP, and Web for request response
 - [x] have identity available to business logic
 - [x] have logs available for review (no writing to file, ephemoral)

## jacspy

 - [x] make decorator for easy use in @tools
 - [x] new local builder
 - [x] fastmcp client and server sse
 - [x] jacspy test -  sign(content) -> (signature, agentid, agentversion, documentid, documentversion)
 - [x] jacspy test - verify(content, signature, agentid, agentversion) -> bool, error

 
 ### General 

 - init âˆš
 - [x] load(config) -> Agent
 
### detailed
 - [x] make sure config directory is in isolated location, like with key
 - [x] make config and security part of Agent
 - [x] don't use env  everywhere- dep jacspy
   - [x] load multistorage into agent object to re-use
   - [x] BUG keys directory isolation broken when re-using Multistorage. TODO wrap key saving in different function
   - [x] don't use set_env_vars() by default - may be more than one agent in system    
   - [x] change config to have storagetype string, add to config schema
   - write tests for no env vars usage of config
   - load by id from default store
   - [x] don't store passwords in config
   - [x] all old tests and some new tests pass
- [x] cli init function
 - [x] clean up fs defaults in init/config/ 
 - [x] bug with JACS_SCHEMA_AGENT_VERSION didn't have default on cli init
 - [x] separate JACS readme repo readme
 - [x] minimal github actions
 - [x] autodetect public key type
 - [x] refactor API so easier to use from higher level libraries  - create agent, load agent, save document, create document, update document, sign 
   init, load agent, verify agent, verify document, 
   - [x] single init, also signs agent
   - [x] load from config
   - [x] have load agent from config also load keys IF SIGNED
