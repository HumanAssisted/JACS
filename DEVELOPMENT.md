Welcome. Thanks for your help.

The pre-commit hook requires some libraries

See pre-commit

 - install `jq` e.g. `brew install jq`
 - for documentation    `npm install -g @adobe/jsonschema2md`
 - cargo install mdbook

Otherwise it's a standard Rust project.

 - install Rust and your favorite editor
 - see tests, examples, and benches
