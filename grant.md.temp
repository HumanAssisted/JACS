1. The Technology Innovation. (Up to 500 words)
Describe the technical innovation that would be the focus of a Phase I project, including a brief discussion of the origins of the innovation as well as explanation as to why it meets the programâ€™s mandate to focus on supporting research and development (R&D) of unproven, high-impact innovations.

2. The Technical Objectives and Challenges. (Up to 500 words)
Describe the R&D or technical work to be done in a Phase I project, including a discussion of how and why the proposed work will help prove that the product or service is technically feasible and/or will significantly reduce technical risk. Discuss how, ultimately, this work could contribute to making the new product, service, or process commercially viable and impactful. This section should also convey that the proposed work meets the definition of R&D, rather than straightforward engineering or incremental product development tasks.

3. The Market Opportunity. (Up to 250 words)
Describe the customer profile and pain point(s) that will be the near-term commercial focus related to this technical project.

# about me

Graduated with a computer science degree in 2004 from Northeastern U after having my own contracting company.
I concentrated on databases and my capstone project was social network analysis using the semantic web. Upon graduating, I founded a nonprofit to use semantic web to catalog human conflict and develop algorithms for conflict resolution like multiplayer Nash.
I didn't know how to run a nonprofit with such a moonshot mission, so I started working.

I've wanted to contribute to my country and society in general, so I've worked for mission driven companies.
Some highlights in my career have been in the significant and early contributions in three successful startups in education technology, mental health care and ML, air quality data.
I bring practical experience in managing data, budgets, and people in uncertain environments.


The NSF seed grant would be a fullfillment of a dream to work on what I'm most passionate about; helping create a safe transition to rapid progress in the age of AI.
